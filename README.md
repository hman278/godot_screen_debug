# Godot Screen Debugging

This tool helps you print debug messages to the screen akin to UE4.

# How to use

Add the screen_debug folder to your addons folder or just copy the addons folder from this repository into your project folder. Enable the plugin in the settings. Create a script (it works with tool modifiers too), and in it call Debug.add_on_screen_debug_message() anywhere with its appropriate parameteres and there you have it.
